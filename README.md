# Last_Man_Standing

For this code I decided to dive deeper into artificial agents. I used the code from the A4 - Artificial Agents assignment but I greatly modified. For this project there are three different bots, one that teleports; one that randomly goes up, down, left, or right; and one that can continue in one direction or randomly goes up, down, left, or right. I added an option for obstacles. The bots are able to "eat" each other and they can run into obstacles. If two bots land on the same position the second bot will "eat" the first bot. If a bot runs into an obstacle it will return to it's previous position. The bots roam around the board until only one bot is left which is the last man standing. My project also returns how many moves it took the bot to win.
